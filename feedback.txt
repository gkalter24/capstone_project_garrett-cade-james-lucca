OVERALL: Borderline Satisfactory/Progressing

* Server and client should take command-line arguments to specify IP address and port, instead of them being hardcoded
* A server that can handle an arbitrary number of pairs of clients (instead of just a single pair) would be ideal
* Client prints "server full" message when server is not even running â€“ "server unavailable" would be more appropriate
* If player 1 disconnects during their turn in a game, player 2 waits for ever, and vice versa
* If server is terminated while playing connect four or hangperson the client enters an infinite loop
* play_game methods for server side of games are quite long
